## E-commerce Application microservices
Our application is a microservices application. It consists of a 9-tier microservices application. The application is an example of back-end for e-commerce application where users can consulte products, add them to the cart, and pass them in an order.

Our goal from this project is not the implementations of microservices patterns and approaches (like SAGA..). This is a demo e-commerce application, made to implements a service mesh solution and *pass our end of studies project*.
